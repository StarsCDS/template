Project To-Do List

1.Synthetic Data Dataloader
- Create a dataloader that generates synthetic data for testing and evaluation purposes.
- Integrate the synthetic data dataloader with the main file.

2.Model Enhancement
- Add more ensemble model options for user.
- Implement additional clustering models to expand the range of options available for analysis.

3.Output Saving Functionality
- Modify the code to save the model outputs, including predictions, graphs, and performance metrics for each model or experiment.
- Ensure that the saved outputs are easily accessible and interpretable for further analysis.

4.Graph Visualization Optimization
- Add a configuration option to control the display of graphs.
- Implement a flag(true/fals) or parameter that allows users to specify whether to print the graphs or not.
- If the flag is set to false, provide alternative text-based representations or summaries of the graph data.
