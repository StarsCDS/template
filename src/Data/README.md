##Creating a custom dataset and dataloaders using the raw data
-Dataset and Dataloaders in pyTorch  are essential for handling data efficiently.
-Here is the resources to get started with:https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/data_tutorial.html
-A custom Dataset class must implement three functions: __init__, __len__, and __getitem__

##Steps to follow for initializing the function create Custom pytorch dataset and dataloaders
-first do environment setup using Poetry, activate the pre-commint and do dvc pull.
-And then run the executable "fashionMNIST.py" file.
